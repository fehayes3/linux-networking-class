# On slide 16 and 17 of the Chapter 13 Networking course slide deck there are commands that can be used to 
# convert a Linux Host into a forwarding router.  Write a script called makeRouter.sh that will perform this 
# conversion.  The commands you would use are shown below. Argument 1 in the external network interface (e.g. 
# NAT interface) and Argument 2 is the internal network interface (e.g. LAN segment 1)  You donâ€™t have to test 
# this script as we will continue editing this script in the next assignment.  If you do decide to test the script, be sure 
# to create a SNAPshot of your Fedora Server before experimenting so that you can revert to your working system 
# after testing.
